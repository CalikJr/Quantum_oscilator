This repository is made for projects conserning quantum phisics and its computational solving.
The main focus is projects for laboratoris in Wasrsaw University of Technology

Project #1
Quantum oscilator is a projekt for solving shroindinger equasion for anharmonicznosc oscilator and ploting how a wave packet behaves in that oscilator. We generated gaussian wave packet and represented it in an eigen vector basics. Then, we added time dependent function and ploted the resolts.
