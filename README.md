This repository is made for projects concerning quantum physics and its computational solving.
The main focus is projects for laboratories in Warsaw University of Technology

Project #1
Quantum oscillator is a project for solving Schrodinger equation for anharmonic oscillator and plotting how a wave packet behaves in that oscillator. We generated gaussian wave packet and represented it in an eigen vector basics. Then, we added time dependent function and plotted the results.
